Roundcube Webmail MarkAsJunk2
=============================
This plugin adds "mark as spam" or "mark as not spam" button to the message
menu.
Inspiration for this plugin was taken from:
Thomas Bruederli <roundcube@gmail.com> - original Roundcube Mark As Junk plugin

When not in the Junk mailbox:
  Messages are moved into the Junk mailbox and marked as read

When in the Junk mailbox:
  The buttons are changed to "mark as not spam" or "this message is not spam"
  and the message is moved to the Inbox

This plugin also integrates with the ContextMenu plugin

The Learning Driver
===================
The learning driver allows you to perform additional processing on each message
marked as spam/ham. A driver must contain a class named markasjunk2_{driver
file name}. The class must contain 2 functions:

spam: This function should take 1 argument, the UID of message being
            marked as spam

ham: This function should take 1 argument, the UID of message being
           marked as ham

Five drivers are provided by default they are:

cmd_learn: This driver calls an external command (for example salearn) to
           process the message

dir_learn: This driver places a copy of the message in a predefined folder, for
           example to allow for processing later

email_learn: This driver emails the message either as an attachment or directly
             to a set address

sa_blacklist: This driver adds the sender address of a spam message to the
              users blacklist (or whitelist of ham messages)
              Requires SAUserPrefs plugin

sa_detach: If the message is a Spamassassin spam report with the original email
           attached then this is detached and saved in the Inbox, the spam
           report is deleted
